# JITCSIM

Just-in time compilation differential equations for simulation of complex network dynamics.

It mainly use [JITC*DE](https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode) packages for solving differential equations.
Check JITC*DE [documentation](https://jitcode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.

For a quick review of what you can use **jitcsim** for, look at the [notebooks](https://github.com/Ziaeemehr/JITCSIM/tree/master/jitcsim/examples/notebooks).


### installation tha latest changes

```sh
cd JITCSIM # directory where you have setup.py
pip3 install -e .
```

### install from pip (v 0.0.1)
```sh
pip3 install jitcsim
```


This is a new project, so the changes will be considerable until v 1.0.
