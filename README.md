# JiTCSim

Just-in time compilation of differential equations for simulation of complex network dynamics.

It mainly use [JiTC*DE](https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode) packages for solving differential equations.
Check `JITC*DE` [documentation](https://jitcode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.


The JiTCSim [documentation](https://ziaeemehr.github.io/JITCSIM/) page or [pdf](https://github.com/Ziaeemehr/JITCSIM/raw/master/docs/jitcsim.pdf) file. 

For a quick review of what you can use **jitcsim** for, look at the [notebooks](https://github.com/Ziaeemehr/JITCSIM/tree/master/jitcsim/examples/notebooks).

I appreciate *Gerrit Ansmann* for preparing `JiTC*DE` packages and many helps at resolving issues.
